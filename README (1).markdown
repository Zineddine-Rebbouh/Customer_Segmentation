# üõí Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

This project focuses on **customer segmentation** using **unsupervised machine learning techniques**. By applying **K-Means clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, we group customers into meaningful clusters to understand their purchasing behavior for applications like targeted marketing and product recommendations.

---

## üìå Objectives

- Segment customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior.
- Apply **K-Means clustering** to identify natural patterns in the data.
- Use the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Analysis** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Apply **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and visualization.
- Follow real-world **best practices** for data preprocessing, scaling, and evaluation.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: K-Means clustering, PCA, and silhouette analysis.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data visualizations.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `CustomerSegmentation.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, EDA, clustering, PCA, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).

## üìä Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values (if any).  
   - Scale features using StandardScaler for fair clustering.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze feature distributions and correlations.  
   - Visualize customer attributes (e.g., histograms, pair plots).  

3. **Clustering with K-Means**  
   - Apply the K-Means algorithm to group customers.  
   - Use the **Elbow Method** to identify the optimal number of clusters.  
   - Validate cluster quality with the **Silhouette Score**.  

4. **PCA for Visualization**  
   - Reduce high-dimensional data to 2D using PCA.  
   - Create scatter plots to visualize customer segments.  

5. **Insights & Interpretation**  
   - Analyze characteristics of each cluster.  
   - Suggest business applications: targeted marketing, product recommendations, loyalty programs.

## üìå Example Visualizations

- **Elbow Method**: Plot to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Silhouette Analysis**: Visual representation of cluster cohesion and separation.
- **PCA Scatter Plot**: 2D visualization of customer segments in reduced feature space.
