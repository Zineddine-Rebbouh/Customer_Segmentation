# ðŸ›’ Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning  

This project focuses on **customer segmentation** using **unsupervised machine learning techniques**.  
By applying **K-Means clustering** and **PCA visualization**, we group customers into meaningful clusters to better understand their purchasing behavior.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives  
- Segment customers into distinct groups.  
- Apply **K-Means clustering** to identify natural patterns.  
- Use **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Analysis** to select the optimal number of clusters.  
- Apply **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and visualization.  
- Follow real-world **best practices** for preprocessing, scaling, and evaluation.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** â€“ data manipulation  
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ clustering, PCA, silhouette analysis  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** â€“ visualizations

## ðŸ“Š Project Workflow  

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values (if any).  
   - Scale features for fair clustering.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understand distributions and correlations.  
   - Visualize customer attributes.  

3. **Clustering with K-Means**  
   - Apply K-Means algorithm.  
   - Use **Elbow Method** to determine the right number of clusters.  
   - Validate with **Silhouette Score**.  

4. **PCA for Visualization**  
   - Reduce dimensions to 2D for plotting.  
   - Scatter plots of clusters in PCA space.  

5. **Insights & Interpretation**  
   - Analyze cluster characteristics.  
   - Potential business applications: targeted marketing, product recommendations, loyalty programs.
